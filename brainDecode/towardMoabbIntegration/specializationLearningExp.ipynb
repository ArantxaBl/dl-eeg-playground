    "This project consist in deriving a two-stages training process from the brain decode implementation of a Shallow Convolutional Network. The core motivation is to combine the strenghts of deep learning - that is being one of the most powerful ML algorithms out-there - while grinding down it's fall back - it requires an immense of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to develop a method to train the network in two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Train the network over a large dataset, this training forms some kind of prior over the network (all but one subject)\n",
    "2) Train the network a second time, on the dataset of interest (the subject left aside)\n",
    "The premise motivating this approach is that the second training is likely to proceed faster than what is normally required to train a deep net, without sacrificing the performance, and will enable the possibility to train a deep learner on a smaller dataset; further, we suspect that the second training will be able to exploit the specificities of the dataset of interest in a way to surpasses the first training, which was trained on a generalistic dataset."
